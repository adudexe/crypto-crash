# ðŸ’¥ Crypto Crash Game â€“ Backend

Hi, Iâ€™m Adwaidh Babu, and this is the backend system I built for a real-time multiplayer crash game called **Crypto Crash**. The idea is simple: players place bets in USD, which gets converted to BTC or ETH using live market prices, and they try to cash out before the multiplier crashes.

Itâ€™s a full-stack backend with real-time WebSocket updates, crypto price integration, provably fair crash logic, and wallet simulation. Iâ€™ve used **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO** for this project.
